\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The previous note \cite{mmtp} reported that based on the measured ART resolution, the MMTP algorithm requires an ART collection window of 6-8 BCs for a fully efficient trigger. Furthermore, we saw that the MMTP performance was extremely sensitive to correlated background hits from $\delta$-rays. To study the effect of uncorrelated background, we implement a faithful software simulation of the MMTP algorithm, called the Harvard Octuplet Trigger Performance Optimization Tool (HOTPOT).
